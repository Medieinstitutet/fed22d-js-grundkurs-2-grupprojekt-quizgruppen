# QUIZ GAME 🚀

A school project where we developed a quiz game. The quiz has 3 categories and 3 difficulties to choose from.

The categories:
- Animals 🐹
- Geography 🌍
- Computer 💻

Each correct answer in the easy category grants you 1 point.   
Medium 2 points, and hard 3 points. Each category is worth the same amount of points. If you answer quickly enough, you will be rewarded with a bonus point 🏆
